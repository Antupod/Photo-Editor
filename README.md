# Photo-Editor

In this project, I wanted to work with various input types and filters in css. 
While it has not turned out the way I wanted, I want to finalize a lot more.

What do we have so far
------
* filters are applied separately from each other

What else would I like to finalize
-----
* Applying filters separately
* More editing options(adding text, highlighting, etc.)
